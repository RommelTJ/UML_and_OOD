# Object-Oriented Analysis and Design

## Fundamental Object-Oriented Analysis and Design Concepts

* Collect Requirements
  * What are we trying to solve?
  * What functionality do we need to build to solve these problems?
  * Document important decisions
* Describe the Software
  * Describe from the user's point of view
  * Create wireframes or prototypes
* Identify the classes
* Create diagrams
  * We use UML here.
  * UML is a graphical notation used to describe object-oriented systems

## Collecting Requirements

* Requirement: A thing that is needed or wanted.
* Functional requirements
  * The features of the system
  * Defines how to react to an input
  * Determines the expected behavior
* Non-functional requirements
  * Not directly required by the functional requirements
  * Ex: Performance, legal, and documentation requirements
* Write down the requirements
  * Format: <The app> must do <something>
  * You can also use formal steps or systems
* Define what the system needs to do
* Identify constraints and boundaries
