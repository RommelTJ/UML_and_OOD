# Object-Oriented Analysis and Design

## Fundamental Object-Oriented Analysis and Design Concepts

* Collect Requirements
  * What are we trying to solve?
  * What functionality do we need to build to solve these problems?
  * Document important decisions
* Describe the Software
  * Describe from the user's point of view
  * Create wireframes or prototypes
* Identify the classes
* Create diagrams
  * We use UML here.
  * UML is a graphical notation used to describe object-oriented systems

## Collecting Requirements

* Requirement: A thing that is needed or wanted.
* Functional requirements
  * The features of the system
  * Defines how to react to an input
  * Determines the expected behavior
* Non-functional requirements
  * Not directly required by the functional requirements
  * Ex: Performance, legal, and documentation requirements
* Write down the requirements
  * Format: <The app> must do <something>
  * You can also use formal steps or systems
* Define what the system needs to do
* Identify constraints and boundaries

## Mapping Requirements to Technical Descriptions

* Describe the system from the user's point of view
* How to describe the use case
  * Title: Short and descriptive
  * Actor: User
  * Scenario: Explain how the software works in this scenario
* Descriptions and formats should be clear to non-technical users
* You can also use User Stories
  * 1-2 sentences long
  * Format: As a <type of user>, I want <some goal> so that <some reason>
  * Use them to ignite discussions instead of describing details

## Why do we need a common descriptive language?

* The lack of a commonly accepted design language led to the proliferation of different non-standard approaches
* UML is a proposed standard to solve this problem
* UML can both describe structure and behavior of a system
