# Core Object-Orientation Concepts

## Brief History of Programming

* Computer programs started as non-structured programming (1950s).
  * Code was a sequence of instructions.
  * Hard to maintain or understand (spaghetti code)
* Then came Structure programming (1960s).
  * Breaks down code into logical steps and subroutines.
  * The C programming language is an example.
  * As programs got bigger, it became more complex.
* Then came Object-Oriented Programming (1980s)
  * Split apart program into self-contained objects.
  * An objects functions as a separate program and operates on its own data.

## Objects

* Objects have properties, identity (state), and behaviors.

## The Class

* We need a class to create objects. 
* The blueprint of an object.
* Classes have properties and actions (methods).
* Classes can be packaged into libraries and reused elsewhere.
