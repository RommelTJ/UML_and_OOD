# Traditional and Agile Software Development

## What are Software Development Methodologies?

* Lack of well-defined process leads to chaos.
* There are many different approaches.
* Waterfall model requires you to have a detailed plan before you start work
* Agile approach works well for projects where projects can change often.

## The Waterfall Model

* It's a linear model
* It defines development steps or phases
* It gives a steady downward order
* Each development phase requires the previous one to be completed.
* Steps
  * Requirements Gathering
  * Architecture Definition
  * Implementation Phase
  * Verification Phase
  * Maintenance Phase
* If you need new features, you should set up a new Waterfall project.
* Candidates for waterfall are Life-control systems, Medical systems, and Military systems.
* Good choice is requirements don't change over time.
* Not good if requirements change frequently.
