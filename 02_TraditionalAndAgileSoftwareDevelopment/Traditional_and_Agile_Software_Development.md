# Traditional and Agile Software Development

## What are Software Development Methodologies?

* Lack of well-defined process leads to chaos.
* There are many different approaches.
* Waterfall model requires you to have a detailed plan before you start work
* Agile approach works well for projects where projects can change often.

## The Waterfall Model

* It's a linear model
* It defines development steps or phases
* It gives a steady downward order
* Each development phase requires the previous one to be completed.
* Steps
  * Requirements Gathering
  * Architecture Definition
  * Implementation Phase
  * Verification Phase
  * Maintenance Phase
* If you need new features, you should set up a new Waterfall project.
* Candidates for waterfall are Life-control systems, Medical systems, and Military systems.
* Good choice is requirements don't change over time.
* Not good if requirements change frequently.

## The Agile Approach

* Began with Agile Manifesto (2001)
* Defines 4 values
  * Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
  * Working software over comprehensive documentation
  * Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  * Responding to change over following a plan
* Main idea: provide functional software iteratively
* Work is broken up into sprints: 2-4 weeks long
* Customers can provide early feedback
* Business users are involved in development
* Good choice for projects with uncertain factors that expect change
* Agile is not a methodology. It's a way of thinking. 
  * Scrum and Kanban are methodologies that implement the Agile approach.
